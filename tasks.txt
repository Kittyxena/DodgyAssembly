T1: 1 + 3 + 5
T2:(9 mod 2) + (7 * 5) in R5
T3: 5 * 5 * 5 in memory at address 4
T4:  First get a value from input using the new
 command INP [n/a] [n/a] that stores user input into R1
 If the value in R1 (x) is even, then do (x - 1) * ( x + 1)
 else do (x / 2) + (x * 2) where x is the original value in R1








T13 Take an input N and do the following until you reach 1.

If the current number N is odd then 3 * N + 1 
and take the result as the new current number N


If it is even then divide it by 2 and take the result 
as the new current number N


When N == 1 stop
